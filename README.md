# About
This was a project from my second year of study where we had to create a text based board game using Java.

I chose to create Tic Tac Toe and Othello.

As a side project I decided that I would enhance this and create a graphical version of these games using a simple MVC design pattern.

The AI's are a latter project I am planning on working on right now they are 3 very simple algorithms first avaliable move,
greedy move and random

A UML diagram provided (JPG file) that shows the entire system and it's interactions.


# How to play and launch:
download project on whatever IDE you prefer

Tic Tac Toe: im sure you know how to play this ;)

To launch the text version simply run TicTacToe class 
to launch the graphical version simply run the GraphicalTicTacToe class

Othello: The goal of the game is to get as many points as possible. Points are obtained by "flanking" or surrounding
the opponent's pieces with your own. This will then change all their pieces to yours.

ex. xooo -> if player x flanks player o -> xoox -> xxxx -> this will equal 4 points

To launch the text version simply run Othello class 
to launch the graphical version simply run the GraphicalOthello class


enjoy :)
